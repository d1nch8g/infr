You can not win software race in this modern, distributed, open-source world if you are not able to accumulate and integrate different projects in end system, keeping it's cutting edge flow.

Nowadays, even developers tend to use _windows_ or _macos_, because of their habits and retrograde mindset. FMNX provides wide range of development tools and system adjustments, which are making it perfect system for modern development: `git`, `docker`, `go`, `node`, `rust`, `v`, `flutter`, `zsh+` and many more.

This distribution is built for developers, who want to start using the world's most advanced open-source tooling without any hustle to instantly start building awesome projects.

## Secure your software

This distribution is built with a thought to offer not just another linux distribution, but a set of easy to deploy infrastructure services, that will help individuals and companies secure their data and software they use.

We introduce [fmnx-pkg](https://fmnx.ru/dancheg97/fmnx-pkg) - self-hosted dockerized repository for arch packages. This project's goal is to provide ability for companies to deploy their own pacman repository in under 5 minutes in any docker container environment (docker/kubernetes/swarm/etc). Repository allows to download packages from AUR, upload `.pkg.tar.zst` and automatically checks integrity and compatability using [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) under the hood. Also offers friendly UI written in dart and gRPC-web based public API.

## Increase complexity

Similarly, as `nuxt` is built on top of `vue`, providing better development experience for complex project, this system goal is to prcisely choose the correct level of abstraction to start building awesome tooling on top of existing software.

So, we built our installation UI: [fmnx-install](https://fmnx.ru/dancheg97/fmnx-install) on top of `archinstall` utility. This beautiful app is only making system calls to archinstall, providing excellent user experience.

This is the main principal we use to choose our development projects and ideas: `data security & abstraction complexity`. This allows us not to rebuild things, that are already built, but built something new on top of existing projects.
