We all value linux for being a community driven software project, for it's openness and principals of it's developers. This distro was built with different thoughts in mind. Nowadays, even developers tend to use _windows_ or _macos_, because of their habits and retrograde mindset. FMNX provides wide range of development tools and system adjustments, which are making it perfect system for modern developers: `git`, `docker`, `go`, `node`, `rust`, `v`, `flutter`, `zsh+` and many more.

This distribution is built for developers, who want to start using the world's most advanced open-source tooling without any hustle to and instantly start building awesome projects.

Also, we try to develope and provide easy to use self-hosted services, which main idea is about securing user's data, software and companies business processes.
